What is an Orizzonte Curvo
Orizzonte Curvo is an Italian word, I am Italian by the way, that means Curved Orizon.
About twenty years ago I was looking a documentary about Ernesto Guevara and a Mexican  Writer, Paco Ignacio Taibo II, was speaking about utopy. He said Utopy is like a curved Orizon, sometimes nearer, sometimes farer, but you know it's there and you know that one day you could possibly reach it.
At the time I was struggling to get my life straight, I suffered a sudden loss in my family few years before and from there I couldn't have nothing properly done, I wondered from day to day trying to understand my place in the world, trying to get my mind in order, trying to get prepared to live my life as an adult, I was around my twenties at the time.
This idea of the curved Orizon got stuck in my head and gave me hope that I could really do something good about my life. Not now, not a in a year, but it was there, like an utopy, and with time, and hope and patience I could have possibly accomplished it.
More than  20 years have passed and I have actually got done many things in my life, that for me are special achievements and that I could just dream on at the time.
But the idea of the utopy as a curved orizon is always there, stucked in my mind, and gives me hope, every day, for my dreams yet to come.
